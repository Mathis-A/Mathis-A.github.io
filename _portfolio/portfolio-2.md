This work was realized as part of a thesis in education sciences. It focused on proving that teachers -for example, but also other people in the department of Education- can move from one location to another in France, but they tend to stick to a same level of rurality. This requires parsing through answers to a form, and using mapping-related tools.

This is a future project.
